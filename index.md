I recently earned my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology under [Dr. Ari Glezer](http://fmrl.gatech.edu). My research was in experimental fluid mechanics.  More specifically, I studied the effect of active flow control on the flow separation and resulting streamwise vortices in offset diffusers and its effects on aircraft engine performance.

Through my research I developed skills in prototyping, experimental design, data analysis and visualization. Outside of my research, I have an interest in high performance computing, modeling and simulation, and data science, which I pursued in part through a minor in computational science and engineering.  Besides this classroom experience, I pursue independent projects in areas including computational fluid dynamics and data visualization.
