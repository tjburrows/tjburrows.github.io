In August 2020 I earned my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech under [Dr. Ari Glezer](http://fmrl.gatech.edu). My research was in experimental fluid mechanics.  I studied the effect of active flow control on the flow separation and resulting streamwise vortices in offset diffusers and its effects on aircraft engine performance.

Through this research I developed skills in prototyping, experimental design, data analysis and visualization. Outside of research, I have an interest in high performance computing, modeling and simulation, and data science, which I pursued in part through a minor in computational science and engineering.  Besides this classroom experience, I pursue independent projects in areas including computational fluid dynamics and machine learning.

I am currently a software engineer at Google.
