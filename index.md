I am a PhD candidate in the Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, under [Dr. Ari Glezer](http://fmrl.gatech.edu).  My research is in experimental fluid mechanics.  More specifically, I study the effect of active flow control on the flow separation and resulting three-dimensional vortical structure inside offset diffusers, and its effects on aircraft engine performance.
